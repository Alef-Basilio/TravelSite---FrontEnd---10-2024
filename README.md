<h2 id="tech" align="center">Technologies</h2>
JavaScript, HTML and CSS.


<h2 id="how" align="center">How was made</h2>
I implemented multiple components in each section, such as translation, adaptive layout, among others, so that the user has an engaging interaction with the elements.
</br>
I used many CSS features (hover, media, etc.) while maintaining visual cohesion in order to overcome the limits I learned from the courses with this markup language.
</br>
The varying responses of the components were a challenge for responsiveness, however, it was successfully achieved thanks to creative solutions such as the existence of two dynamic menus.


<h2 id="obj" align="center">Objective</h2>
Evolve my page styling limits.
